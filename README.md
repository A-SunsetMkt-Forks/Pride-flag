# Pride flag
Solidarity, unity, intersectionality. These are the themes we reflect on in this Pride flag. Created with and by the LGBTQIA+ people at Microsoft, it combines 40 individual LGBTQIA+ communities' flags in a single powerful graphic. Inspired by the public response, we're making it availaible for everyone to use, add to, and build on.
