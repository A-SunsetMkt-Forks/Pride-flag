# A Banner of Pride
In 2022, we open-sourced our Pride flag design representing 40 LGBTQIA+ communities. Our latest update reflects 74 identities. Plus, we are [open-sourcing the entire Pride design](https://github.com/microsoft/Pride) and invite you to remix, share and make more Pride.

Created by the LGBTQIA+ people, this year’s flag design represents 74 individual communities—with one powerful graphic that reflects a message of unity, solidarity, and intersectionality. It celebrates a community that’s wide, global, and ever-growing. We’re making it available here on GitHub for everyone to use, share and build on. Because Pride should be open source.
