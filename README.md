# Pride flag
Our Pride flag combines over 30 LGBTQIA+ community flags in a single powerful graphic, evoking a sense of power and unity. This flag was first used during Microsoft's Pride campaign in 2022. Following popular demand, we're making it availaible for everyone with a CC-BY-4.O license. Make it yours.
